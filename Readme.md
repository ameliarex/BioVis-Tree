**Construction of the Tree (Hierarchical Clustering)**



**Draw the Tree**

The animal names are listed out at the bottom of the screen. 

The first number of pairs are all closest to each other. They are connected to each other. Then comes the animals with higher hierarchy, which connects with the previous pairs with longer and higher brackets. Then all connected pairs and/or groups are connected according to their average distances to each other. 

**Beyond the Requirements**

*Technical*

The addition of mouseover tags for text boxes (The animal names are written in invisible text boxes).
